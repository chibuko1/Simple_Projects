This folder contains a python program that keeps track of all the movies and tv shows the user has seen using JSON.
The program continually asks the user if they have any more tv shows or movies to enter until they are satisfied with the list they provide.
The program also asks the user if they have an already created JSON file of movies or tv shows that they have seen so that their list is saved elsewhere when
the program is done running.
The tv shows and movies are also created as classes so if there is any future need to update any functionality with the tv shows or movies it can be done.
